# Blizzard downloader:
# * Uses a single archive file with random range requests.
#   To combat this we use proxy_cachable_range instead of http_range which rewrites
#   the ranges so they are predicable.
# * Mainly uses 1048576 byte requests but ranges overlap quite a bit so we use the
#   same size as Origin.
